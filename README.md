# Automated Tolling System

Our world needs more people to look after it as the days go by, and we have dedicated the purpose of this project to do so. Smart cities are everywhere nowadays, and with their evolution a huge load of benefits adjoin. One of which can be an Intelligent Transportation System that does not only care about enhancing the traffic management but also about decreasing the obstructive characteristics of the vehicles that roam our streets. One of many is the pollution caused by the gas emission of every individual car that takes the street. For that, we have proposed an automated tolling system that charges drivers based on their car's gas per mile emission taken from the U.S. government's official fuel economy website "www.fueleconomy.gov". This solution will debit drivers based a on known criteria that later on, they will be able to choose from when buying a car. Aiming to eliminate the delay of collecting the fee as well, an RFID based tolling system is built, processed by a server connected to a cloud database of the registered cars matching any passage and deducting the calculated fee at the moment.

## Getting Started

Download the Arduino Code and run it on Arduino IDE. Then download the JS & HTML files and place them in your own built from scratch MEAN Stack application. Create an account on Mongo Atlas to be able to connect to the cloud then replace the username & password parts. As well as make sure you choose a non used localhost address.

### Prerequisites

VS Code or any alike software. Arduino IDE
